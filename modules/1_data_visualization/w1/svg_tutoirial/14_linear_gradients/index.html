		<h1>Example 1: linear gradients - &lt;linearGradient&gt;</h1>
		<p>
			The &lt;linearGradient&gt; element is used to define a linear gradient.
			<br><br>
			The &lt;linearGradient&gt; element must be nested within a &lt;defs&gt; tag. The &lt;defs&gt; tag is short for definitions and contains definition of special elements (such as gradients).
			<br><br>
			Linear gradients can be defined as horizontal, vertical or angular gradients:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Horizontal gradients are created when y1 and y2 are equal and x1 and x2 differ
				</li>
				<li>
					Vertical gradients are created when x1 and x2 are equal and y1 and y2 differ
				</li>
				<li>
					Angular gradients are created when x1 and x2 differ and y1 and y2 differ
				</li>
			</ul>
			This example defines an ellipse with a horizontal linear gradient from yellow to red:
		</p>
		<svg 
			height = "150" 
			 width = "400"
		>
			<defs>
				<linearGradient 
					id = "grad1" 
					x1 = "0%" 
					y1 = "0%" 
					x2 = "100%" 
					y2 = "0%"
				>
					<stop 
						offset = "0%" 
						 style = "
						 	  stop-color: rgb(255,255,0);
						 	stop-opacity: 1;
						 " 
					/>
					<stop 
						offset = "100%" 
						 style = "
						 	  stop-color: rgb(255,0,0);
						 	stop-opacity: 1;
						 " 
					/>
				</linearGradient>
			</defs>
			<ellipse 
				  cx = "200" 
				  cy = "70" 
				  rx = "85" 
				  ry = "55" 
				fill = "url(#grad1)" 
			/>

		<h1>Example 2: linear gradients - &lt;linearGradient&gt;</h1>
		<p>
			Define an ellipse with a vertical linear gradient from yellow to red:
		</p>
		<svg 
			height = "150" 
			 width = "400"
		>
			<defs>
				<linearGradient 
					id = "grad2" 
					x1 = "0%" 
					y1 = "0%" 
					x2 = "0" 
					y2 = "100%"

					<stop 
						offset = "0%" 
						 style = "
						 	  stop-color: rgb(255,255,0);
						 	stop-opacity: 1;
						 " 
					/>
					<stop 
						offset = "100%" 
						 style = "
						 	  stop-color: rgb(255,0,0);
						 	stop-opacity: 1;
						 " 
					/>
				</linearGradient>
			</defs>
			<ellipse 
				  cx = "200" 
				  cy = "70" 
				  rx = "85" 
				  ry = "55" 
				fill = "url(#grad2)" 
			/>

		<h1>Example 3: linear gradients - &lt;linearGradient&gt;</h1>
		<p>
			Define an ellipse with a horizontal linear gradient from yellow to red, and add a text inside the ellipse:
		</p>
		<svg 
			height = "150" 
			 width = "400"
		>
			<defs>
				<linearGradient 
					id = "grad3" 
					x1 = "0%" 
					y1 = "0%" 
					x2 = "100%" 
					y2 = "0"
				>
					<stop 
						offset = "0%" 
						 style = "
						 	  stop-color: rgb(255,255,0);
						 	stop-opacity: 1;
						 " 
					/>
					<stop 
						offset = "100%" 
						 style = "
						 	  stop-color: rgb(255,0,0);
						 	stop-opacity: 1;
						 " 
					/>
				</linearGradient>
			</defs>
			<ellipse 
				  cx = "200" 
				  cy = "70" 
				  rx = "85" 
				  ry = "55" 
				fill = "url(#grad3)" 
			/>
			<text 
				   fill = "#ffffff" 
			  font-size = "45" 
			font-family = "Verdana" 
					  x = "150" 
					  y = "86"
