## SVG Gradients

A gradient is a smooth transition from one color to another. In addition, several color transitions can be applied to the same element.

There are two main types of gradients in SVG:

* Linear
* Radial





## SVG Linear Gradient - <linearGradient>

The `<linearGradient>` element is used to define a linear gradient.

The `<linearGradient>` element must be nested within a `<defs>` tag. The `<defs>` tag is short for definitions and contains definition of special elements (such as gradients).

Linear gradients can be defined as horizontal, vertical or angular gradients:

* Horizontal gradients are created when y1 and y2 are equal and x1 and x2 differ
* Vertical gradients are created when x1 and x2 are equal and y1 and y2 differ
* Angular gradients are created when x1 and x2 differ and y1 and y2 differ





## Example 1:SVG linear gradient <linearGradient>

Code explanation:

* The id attribute of the <linearGradient> tag defines a unique name for the gradient
* The x1, x2, y1,y2 attributes of the <linearGradient> tag define the start and end position of the gradient
* The color range for a gradient can be composed of two or more colors. Each color is specified with a <stop> tag. The offset attribute is used to define where the gradient color begin and end
* The fill attribute links the ellipse element to the gradient

## Example 3:SVG linear gradient <linearGradient>

Code explanation:

* The `<text>` element is used to add a text
