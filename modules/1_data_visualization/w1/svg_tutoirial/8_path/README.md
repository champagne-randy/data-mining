## SVG path - <path>

The `<path>` element is used to define a path. The following commands are available for path data:

* M = moveto
* L = lineto
* H = horizontal lineto
* V = vertical lineto
* C = curveto
* S = smooth curveto
* Q = quadratic Bézier curve
* T = smooth quadratic Bézier curveto
* A = elliptical Arc
* Z = closepath

Note: All of the commands above can also be expressed with lower letters. Capital letters means absolutely positioned, lower cases means relatively positioned.




## Example 1: SVG path - <path>

No explanation




## Example 2: SVG path - <path>

Complex? YES!!!! Because of the complexity involved in drawing paths it is highly recommended to use an SVG editor to create complex graphics.
