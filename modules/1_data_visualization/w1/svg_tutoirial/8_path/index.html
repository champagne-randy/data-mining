		<h1>Example 1: path</h1>
		<p>
			The &lt;path&gt; element is used to define a path. The example below defines a path that starts at position 150,0 with a line to position 75,200 then from there, a line to 225,200 and finally closing the path back to 150,0:
		</p>
			<svg height = "210" 
				 width 	= "400"
			>
			<path 	d = "
						M 150 0 
						L 75 200 
						L 225 200 
						Z
					" 
			/>

			Bezier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. Generally, the user selects two endpoints and one or two control points. A Bezier curve with one control point is called a quadratic Bezier curve and the kind with two control points is called cubic.
			<br><br>
			The following example creates a quadratic Bezier curve, where A and C are the start and end points, B is the control point:
